    "1. Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS:- Functions are very much usefull when it comes to reducing the duplication of the code , breaking of complex programs into       simpler pices , it improves the clarity of the code .\n",
    "\n",
    "2. When does the code in a function run: when it's specified or when it's called?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS:- A function is a block of code that only runs when it is called. In Python functions return a value using a return statement, if one is specified. A function can be called anywhere after the function has been declared.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What statement creates a function?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS:- A 'def' statement creates a function the syntax for writing a function is :-  def function_name(arguments):\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What is the difference between a function and a function call?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS:- A function is a block of code that only runs when it is called. In Python functions return a value using a return               statement, if one is specified. A function can be called anywhere after the function has been declared.\n",
    "         whereas a function call refers to call a defined function to reuse it.you can call a function by its name for e.g:-\n",
    "              def test():\n",
    "                print(\"this is my first function\")\n",
    "                \n",
    "                test()     ------ it is calling the already defined function test .       \n",
    "         \n",
    "5. How many global scopes are there in a Python program? How many local scopes?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS:- For any python program, there can be only one global scope. The global scope is created once the program starts and gets       destroyed with the termination of the python program.\n",
    "\n",
    "              for e.g:-          a=2         <------------------  global variable\n",
    "                                 def test():\n",
    "                                    b=8         <---------------- local variable\n",
    "                                    print(\"this is my first function\")\n",
    "                                    return b\n",
    "             The local scope of a function is loaded when the function is called by any other function. Once the function terminates, the local scope associated with it is also terminated.\n",
    "             \n",
    "             \n",
    "6. What happens to variables in a local scope when the function call returns?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS:- The local scope of a function is loaded when the function is called by any other function. Once the function terminates,        the local scope associated with it is also terminated.\n",
    "          memory is automatically allocated when the function is called and automatically deallocated when the function ends in               the case of local scope.\n",
    "             \n",
    "7. What is the concept of a return value? Is it possible to have a return value in an expression?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS:-  The Python return statement is a key component of function. You can use the return statement to make your function send        Python objects back to the caller code. These objects are known as the function’s return value. \n",
    "            A return value can be used as a part of an expression like any value.\n",
    "              \n",
    "8. If a function does not have a return statement, what is the return value of a call to that function?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS:-If a function does not have a return statement,the return value of a call to that function is nonetype.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. How do you make a function variable refer to the global variable?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS:-Use of global Keyword If your function has a local variable with the same name as a global variable and you want to change       the global variable within the function, use the ‘global’ keyword before the variable name at the start of the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. What is the data type of None?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS:-None keyword is an object and is a data type of none type class. None datatype doesn’t contain any value. None keyword is      used to define a null variable or object in python.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. What does the sentence import areallyourpetsnamederic do?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS:- It is giving me module not found error while importing.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. If you had a bacon() feature in a spam module, what would you call it after importing spam?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS:- after importing it i will call it by spam.bacon()\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "13. What can you do to save a programme from crashing if it encounters an error?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS:-i can write the code inde a try block which i think that may crash. and the rest of the code will be kept inside the             exception block.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. What is the purpose of the try clause? What is the purpose of the except clause?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS:- whenever you have a suspicious block of code we should keep that block inside the try block. and the rest of the block         should be kept inside the exception block to handle the exception if the try block fails.  \n",
